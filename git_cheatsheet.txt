vi .gitignore - changes to .gitignore edit screen - type full file name (/directory name),
add # -.gitignore below all file listings
git log - brings up commit history
git log --oneline - brings up simplified commit history
git remote add origin <github.com repository file path> - connects a github repository with your local repository
git remote -v - displays remote connected repository list  
git remote rm origin - removes remote repository
git push origin <branch name> - pushes code from the specified branch to the remote repository
git checkout origin/master - displays current pull data
git fetch - pull all current information from remote repo
git checkout <name> - switch branch to <name>
git merge origin/master - merge changes made to remote repo
git pull origin master - combine remote changes with local repo 
git clone <repository address> - clones a remote repository from github
git branch - returns the current branch being worked on, noted by an *
git branch -a - returns all branches in repository, current branch noted by an *
git branch <new branch name> creates a new branch with assigned name
git branch -v returns list of branches and details what commits they are associated with
git branch -d <local_branch_name> - deletes branch locally
git push origin --delete <remote_branch_name> - deletes branch remotely
git checkout <name> switches current branch to given branch name
git checkout -b <name> switches current branch to given branch name;
if given name does not exist, creates a new branch with given name, then
switches to it
git merge <branch name> - merges named branch with currently checkedout branch

____RESOLVING MERGE CONFLICTS____
On branch that you want to have the final result, type "vi <conflicting file name>" 
you'll see formatting between the conflicting files
<<<<<<<<HEAD
Hello World!
============
Hello World.
conflicting_merge_files>>>>>>>

delete the extra formating, and make sure only the changes remain that you want
, then save and quit, then add and commit. You will see a "merge conflict commit" 
message, save and quit, and the merge conflict will be resolved with additional
infomation in the git log.

git stash show - returns list of changes to last stashed files
git stash show stash@{index} - returns list of changes to files of specified index
git stash show -p - returns lines of code that were changed in last stashed files
git stash show -p stash@{index} - returns lines of code that were changed in files of specified index
git stash pop - take changes from {0} index stash and apply to current branch
git stash pop stash@{index} - take changes from {index} stash and apply to current branch
git stash drop stash@{index} - delete stashed changes from {index} stash
git stash clear - deletes all items in the stash list

git diff {hash_1} {hash_2} returns changes made during both commits
git revert {hash} inverts changes made to specified commit using {hash} as a reference
without deleting commit history
git reset --soft {hash} reverts to changes made during {hash} commit and puts all
subsequent commits into staging area
git 
git reset --mixed {hash} - directs the MAIN and HEAD to the {hash} commit, and puts
all subsequent commits into the staging area so that you can make changes to a previous 
commit without affecting changes made to other files
git reset --hard {hash} directs the MAIN and HEAD to the {hash} commit, and clears
the staging area and working directory of all files, working directory files are kept as is

git commit --amend - brings up previous commit message to be edited.
changes commit hash, date, and time. Includes any newly staged finles
